# Star Tribune Svelte + Vite Template

This is a template for building Svelte apps at the Star Tribune. It's intended to replace the old svelte+webpack template.

## Starting a project

To start a new project based on this template, run

```
npx degit striblab/strib-svelte-vite-template#main name-of-your-new-project
cd name-of-your-new-project
npm install
```

## Development

To run the dev server run `npm run dev`.

To build for deployment, run `npm run build`.

To preview a built app locally, run `npm run preview`.

## Strib webfonts

Manually place your font folders in the directory `public/fonts/` to render them on the page.
These local fonts will be included in the build and deploy processes until a CORS policy issue can be resolved on static.startribune.com.

## Deploying

Deployment is currently handled by a shell script (`strib-deploy.sh`). You need to have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed
with credentials for the static.startribune.com bucket using the 'default' profile.

To deploy to staging, run `npm run deploy-staging`. For production, run `npm run deploy-production`. This will upload to a typical path using your project's name, which is read from the root directory of your project (where `package.json` is located).

## Deploying to the website

By default, this template expects the built app to be included on a Star Tribune article page via Pym.js. Pym.js configuration for the built app, i.e. the child page, is already handled by default in App.svelte. Find documentation for setting up the parent article [here](https://library.stribapps.com/team-specifics/digital-design-and-production/workflows-and-schemes/using-pym-to-manage-iframed-content-in-arc-articles).

## Deploying offsite

If you wish instead to publish the article entirely on the static server, this template includes header, footer, meta and tracking components. Header and footer components need no configuration â€” simply import them to the App.svelte component. Meta.svelte and GATracking.svelte components should also be included in the App.svelte component. Fill out the data inside `/src/config/seo.json` carefully for proper tracking and pass that data into Meta.svelte and GATracking.svelte as the `data` prop. If deploying offsite, there's no need to include the Pym.js code provided in the App.svelte component.
